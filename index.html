            ​​This has b​een always the main pursuit of our go​vernment, chaired by His Royal Highness Prince
            Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the Prime Minister, with the support of His Royal Highness Prince Salman
            bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince and First Deputy Prime Minister, and aims at reinforcing the
            principle of serving the Bahraini youth in various forums for being the main pillar of the Bahrain
            Vision 2030.

            The launching of the website adds a new dimension in the concept of continuous communication between
            Ministry of Youth & Sports Affairs and young Bahrainis, in line with the strategy of Supreme Council for
            the Youth and Sports and its efforts to developing a young Bahraini generation with loyalty to their
            nation and able to​ actively tak​e part in its development.

            The objective of the Ministry of Youth & Sports Affairs' website is to boost the support process of the
            youth sector in Bahrain and develop their skills, besides enabling them to deal with their present
            developments and challenges efficiently and effectively, and to improve the policies used to develop
            their potential.

            The website underlines the commitment of the Supreme Council for Youth and Sports to support the
            Ministry of Youth & Sports Affairs in activating its role in serving and meeting the needs and
            requirements of youth and sports affiliates and implementing the government policies in the area of
            competence and contribution as we hope that this project would be a useful mean of communication between
            the public and the Bahraini youth and their affiliates so as to contribute in the provision of valuable
            services to promote the youth and sports movement in the Kingdom.

            In conclusion, we ask Almighty God to help us to serve our kingdom and our people, whom we consider as
            the real wealth of this nation.​
